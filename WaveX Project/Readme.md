# WaveX Project ðŸš¤

Welcome to the **WaveX Project** repository! This project involves the creation of two detailed Power BI reports: a Sales Report and an HR Report. The project includes specific requirements for data handling and forecasting.

## Project Overview

### Reports Created:
1. **Sales Report**  
   Provides insights into sales performance, excluding data from the year 2018 and sales data from the discontinued product WR3. Includes a forecast of sales for the next two years.
